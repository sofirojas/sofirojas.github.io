My Website: https://sofirojas.github.io/
I build my website using two HTML5UP templates. They offer great templates for free and are easy to edit as long as you have some HTML knowledge, CSS and Java are helpful a lot too if you want to play more with the design. Hope you enjoy my personal webpage!
