										<h3>Find Universities</h3>
										<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify">Making an excel list is a good idea. Keep it organized and dream big!
										It is wise to keep your options open and <b>apply to your favorite universities and your 'plan-B'</b> also taking into account
										your budget/scholarship opportunities. Instead of looking for 'best-ranked' universities, go to the department websites
										and read the syllabus of a few classes and research opportunities the program has to offer. <b> This university department will be your home and
											support for a good amount of years</b>. You can even contact them
										and ask for more information, don't be shy!
										Depending on the country, the application process varies but here I focus on a few factors to keep in mind...
									 </p>
								 </section>
										<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
											<span class="icon solid alt major fa-graduation-cap"></span>
											<h3>Grades and Research Matter</h3>
											<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify">Try your best to have good grades, this gives you more scholarship options.
											For undergraduate applications, it's good to talk about your extracurriculars and volunteering activities in high-school.
											For graduate school is very important to showcase your undergraduate research. In Colombia, a few universities
											have an astronomer or a contact with whom you can do a bachelor's thesis in astronomy. You can also apply to
											a couple of internships abroad like at
											<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/opportunities/space-astronomy-summer-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STScI</a> or
											<a href="https://www.mpia.de/en/careers/internships/summer"target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MPIA</a>.
											In RECA we offer 10-week
											<a href="https://recastronomia.github.io/internship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer internships</a> to give
										Colombian undergrads the opportunity to do cutting-edge research with astronomers worldwide! At the moment, we don't have
										financial resources to reward students for their hard work.
										<a href="contactme.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact me</a> or
										<a href="https://recastronomia.github.io/contacto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RECA</a> if you might have
										ideas to help us!
										</p>
										</section>
										<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
											<span class="icon solid alt major fa-dollar-sign"></span>
											<h3>Scholarships</h3>
											<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify">We all want them, and many of us live from them.
												In Colombia there is no private or governmental
												institution offering scholarships
											to study abroad. There are only loans and are not great.
											<b>Your Ph.D.</b> tends to be easier to finance in both the U.S. and Europe. Your research supervisor can fully or partially fund your studies and pay you
												a salary. <b>In the U.S. the master's and Ph.D. pograms are joint together into one program for 'Graduate Education'</b>
												so there are rarely problems with funding both. However, <b>in Europe there are scholarships for foreigners to do the Master's Degree</b>
												neither there are funds for your daily expenses. Proof of European ancestry might really help you to study in some countries like Italy.
												For the Ph.D. in Europe, you get a nice salary with social benefits like pension, medical and social insurances.
										 This balance can vary per country and institution but definitely you would not have to take a side job or use up your savings to pay for your Ph.D.,
										 like it is the case in Colombia.
										 <br>
										 For <b>undergraduate education,</b> it's very expensive in the U.S. However, you can look at
									 scholarship opprotunities
									 at the universities where
								 you are planning to apply. Do not be shy and shoot an email to the international office, they will guide you in the right direction!
										 We also have a few tips from the
									<a href="https://recastronomia.github.io/mentores/panel4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RECA mentorship
								 program.</a>
										I was able to do my whole undergrad based on scholarships, and now get paid during my Ph.D. and
								<b>so can you!</b></p>
										</section>
										<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
											<span class="icon solid alt major fa-comments"></span>
											<h3>Language</h3>
											<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify"> Science communications around the world is now mainly dominated by
										English. Any university program outside of Latin America will ask you for the
												<a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TOEFL</a> /
												<a href="https://www.ielts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IELTS</a> test. Find
												 practice questions online, or buy a book to get familiarized with the format of the exam. Even native speakers
												 would perform poorly when going in to the exam with no information or preparation. The issue with these standarized
												 tests is that they grade how well you can answer this exam rather than your true level of English. There is no
												 other solution to prove your language skill for the university, so we all have to go through this process. For
												 some summer internships or mi Ph.D. program <a href= "https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
		 										IMPRS-HD.</a>, you might not be required this test because instead they will have an interview in
												 English with you. Remember the TOEFL or IELTS scores are valid for three years and you can always present the exam as
													many times as you need and submit your best score.
													Break the language barrier and don't stop there, learn to communicate with people in other
											languages, it's fun!</p>

											<span class="icon solid alt major fa-edit"></span>
											<h3>Essays</h3>
											<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify">
											Writing in general is an important skill in science. You want to be able to explain your research, motivations, and proposals clearly.
											Usually essays or a letter
										of statement are required by universities so that they get to know more about you besides the grades. This is similarly required when applying
										for research internships. In Colombia this essay format is not widely taught in school, so we offer
										 <a href="https://recastronomia.github.io/mentores/panel3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few RECA tips.
										</a> I have way more advice and don't mind proof-reading your statement. Contact me <a href="contactme.html">here!</a></p>
										</section>
										<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
											<span class="icon solid alt major fa-chart-area"></span>
											<h3>Exams</h3>
											<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify">Standarized tests like the
												<a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAT</a> /
												<a href="https://www.act.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACT</a>
												are required by universities in the U.S. for undergraduate education.
											For graduate education the <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GRE</a>
											is required in the U.S. Also, the <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about/content/physics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
												GRE-Physics</a> test might be required as well in a
											few universities in the U.S., Europe or Australia but is definitely less common. Similarly, do the practice tests.
											These exams are definitely expensive, so the more you prepare for it the better you will score and won't have to retake the
											exam many more times. I would advice registering for a course that prepares you for these exams.
