							<p style="font-weight:300">My field of expertise is on the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), that is the time when the Universe
								went through a major transition from neutral to ionized Hydrogen gas (going from darkness to light). This process occurred
								at some point when the first galaxies were forming until the the Universe was one billion years old
								(or at high-redshifts <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#8819; 6).


						 	  	<!-- <br> About 400,000 yrs after the <b>Big Bang</b>, the Universe was cool enough so that electrons and photons could combine
									and begin to form neutral hydrogen atoms. This is referred to as the <b>Recombination Era</b> and it was the first major
									phase transition of gas in the Universe. In the mean time, the Universe was living in the <b>Dark Ages</b> as it was filled with
									<i style="color:#62d8ff">neutral hydrogen</i> and
									looked opaque. At some point, the first stars begin to arrange themselves into structures where some are not
								  heavily populated and therefore become <i style="color:#62d8ff">dim galaxies</i>.
									In other rare cases, large populations of stars lead to <i style="color:#62d8ff">massive and very bright galaxies</i>.
									In some even more rare cases, these massive galaxies host a super massive black hole (SMBH) accreting matter
									at such speeds that the energy release makes them shine extremely bright; we call these objects <i style="color:#62d8ff">Quasars</i>.
									All these different structures have in common their strong ionizing power that is able to break down the neutral hydrogen
									surrounding them
									and therefore, illuminate the Universe for the first time revealing its beauty as we see it today!
									This is the <b>Epoch of Reionization (EoR)</b> and we are
									investigating the details of how, who, or when this major transition of the Universe occurred. The concensus up to now is that
									this epoch lasted approximately from
									100 Million - 1 Billion years after the Big Bang (what we call redshift <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#8776;
									 20 - 6, respectively).
							<br> -->

								Among all the amazing things you can study about the EoR, I have been focusing on
									the <b><a href="research.html#borg">massive bright galaxies</a></b>
									and <b><a href="research.html#p352FIR">quasars,</a></b>
									which are galaxies hosting active super massive black holes in their nuclei.

								<h3>Finding Bright Galaxies at <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i>  &#126; 9 in the <em> HST</em> BoRG Survey</h3>
									<p style="font-weight:300"><span class="image left"><a class="image" href="images/LF_Rojas.png"><img src="images/LF_Rojas.png" alt="" /></a></span>I looked for bright galaxies born in the first 500 million years of the
									Universe (or at redhisft <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#126; 9) using the pure-parallel
									<b><a href="http://borg.astro.ucla.edu/">BoRG</a></b> survey from the
									<i> Hubble Space Telescope</i>. This survey has the advantage of covering continuous wavelengths from the visible to near-infrared (λ = 0.35-1.7 μm).
									This way, we can perform the photometric redshift (or drop-out) technique to select Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs).
									For a couple of sources there is additional data at 3.6 μm from the <i>Spitzer Space Telescope</i> that helps to better constrain the photometric
									redshift of the source.
									 We find 11 galaxy candidates at redshift <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i>
									 &#8819; 7 and further study the bright end of the Luminosity Function (LF) at <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#126; 8 and
									 at <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#126; 9 (See Figure on the left).
									  Our comparison to previous studies of LBGs at similar redshifts show that
										there is still a lot of descrepancy on the evolution of the LF at <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#126; 9.

						<h3 style="margin:0 0 0 0">The Role of Powerful Radio Jets in the Host Galaxy of a Quasar at <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px"> z</i> = 5.832</h3>
						<p style="font-weight:300"><span class="image right"><a class="image" href="images/SED_P352-15.png"><img src="images/SED_P352-15.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></span>
							Among the hundreds of quasars that have been discovered during the
							Epoch of Reionization (<i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#8819; 6), only about 10% of the population is bright in radio wavelengths.
							 We study P352-15, the only quasar with direct evidence of
							extended radio jets (∼1.6 kpc)
							 at these high redshifts, and test for the first time the interactions of the radio lobes in the interstellar medium of its host galaxy.
							We analyze the quasar emission in the radio an far-infrared regions of the
							Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). In the <b><span style="color: #61BAF9">Radio</span></b>
							we can study the synchrotron emission from the jets and are able to constrain the
							radio-loudness of the quasar to R>1000 using new observations at 215 MHz from GMRT, making this object one of the
							most powerful radio emitters at such a high redshift.
							In contrast to what is typically observed in high-redshift radio-quiet quasars, we show that cold dust emission alone cannot reproduce
						  the millimeter continuum measurements from ALMA 290 GHz and NOEMA 100 GHz observations
							at the rest frame <span style="color: #92FF00">far-infrared</span> (see Figure to the right).
							This is evidence that the strong synchrotron emission from the quasar contributes substantially to the emission even at millimeter wavelengths
							and hipothesize a <span style="color: #F7CA6F">break in the synchrotron emission</span> between 3 GHz and 100 GHz.

						<h4 style="margin:0 0 0 0"> Gauge the Age of the Jet from P352-15</h4>
						<p style="font-weight:300">We will be able to
						constrain the age of the jet by knowing

						  <b>i)</b> The frequency at which its synchrotron spectrum steepens. For this, I PI a VLA proposal to measure the emission from the
							quasar in all the offered frequency bands (from 1.4 GHz to 45 GHz) in C/D configuration
							 and pinpoint the frequency break.
							 <br>
							<b>ii)</b> The magnetic field strength in the jet. We discovered that P352-15 has extended X-Ray emission in
							<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911..120C/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this paper</a>,
							 probing that the relativistic electrons in the jet cool down mainly via Inverse Compton scattering with the CMB (IC-CMB). Thus, we expect the
							magnetic field in the radio lobe to be less than the magnetic field of the CMB at z=5.83.
							<b>Stay tuned for the results on this research!</b>
