								<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify"><span class="image left"><img src="images/amateur.jpg" alt="" width="240" height='320'></span>
									I was born in Bogota, Colombia and the first movie my parents bought me on Betamax was actually the series of Cosmos by Carl Sagan.
									Growing up my mother was a journalist and professor at a University and my father was an amateur astronomer with a telescope.
									My grandfather showed me many books and we both saw my first partial solar eclipse and my grandma taught me math up
									to multiplication and division. Seems pretty obvious
									now why I chose to do astronomy, but there is more. As many children,
									I dreamed of becoming an astronaut and working for NASA making series like Cosmos. That is what I thought astronomy was and it
									wasn't until I turned 14 years old that the picture began to become more clear to me. I was studying at the
									<a href="https://www.corazonistabogota.com/" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corazonista School in Bogota</a>
									and was just starting to take physics and chemistry classes. Both teachers were very supportive and
								  showed me a path to study natural sciences.
									At the same time, I began to attend public talks on astronomy subjects offered in different universities and
									astronomy societies in Bogota.
									Many of the people giving talks were Colombian professionals in chemistry, physics or engineering who
									shared a passion for astronomy, but only one or two had studied astronomy abroad.
									 In my last year of high school I participated in the National Astronomy Olympiads (IV OCA) and
									later moved on to the Latin American Olympiads (V OLAA).
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/graduation_Steve.jpg" alt="" width="240" height='320'></span>
									<br><br>
									I knew for sure that I wanted to study astronomy, so my mother and I sat down to look for universities. The more I looked the more it became
									clear that
									I had to leave my home country. At the moment, only one university in Colombia was offering an undergraduate degree in astronomy and
									only one student was part of it and had yet to graduate. Going to the U.S. became my best option and I set my mind into it.
									At the age of 16 and only one month after high school graduation, I left to the U.S. and took part of an English program that guided
									me on all university requirements from TOEFL to essay applications to American universities.
									(I have more tips on it <a href="index.html#six">here.</a>)
									A year later and back in Colombia on a sunny April day, I got accepted at The University of Texas at Austin and it became the happiest,
									most unbelievable day of my life.
									Up to this moment, a lot of friends, family and people I knew had told me many times <b>"NO. She cannot possibly get a spot in an American university,
									no one else does that, why don't you just stay in Colombia like everyone else, how are you going to afford it, can you even get a job?"</b>
									 For years, I had been
									used to hearing NO
									so this <b>YES</b> was in a few word <b>'just it.'</b>
									The university tuition was very expensive indeed; my family and I could not afford much more than the first semester of my studies and living expenses.
									Fortunately, there were a few scholarship opportunities for international students to which I applied for every year.
									In my second semester I also began to work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with <a href="http://www.as.utexas.edu/~stevenf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
									Dr. Steven Finkelstein</a>. This is where I developed my passion for studying the early Universe, specifically some of
									the <a href="research.html#borg">first-born galaxies</a> wihtin 500 Million years of the age of the
									Universe (or at redhisft <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#126; 9).
									<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify"><span class="image left"><img src="images/FirstLight_Latinas.jpg" alt="" width="340" height='250'></span>

									I grew a lot and many times the hard way being so far away from home in a different culture, but many people at UT supported me the whole way.
									I will be <b>forever grateful</b> to my supervisor, professors, friends, colleagues, scholarship donors, admin staff and family for helping and teaching me
									to get up and keep moving forward.
									At UT I indeed had many opportunities to showcase my research and also took over summer
									internships to explore more of the astronomy community both in the U.S. and in Europe. It wasn't until after graduating with a B.S. in astronomy and
									a B.S. in physics at the age of 22, that
									I began to meet more Colombians studying astronomy and spaces sciences abroad. I attended
									the <a href="http://www.firstlight.iag.usp.br/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First Light School</a>
									 at the University of São Paulo, Brazil where I met for the first time so many more Latin
									American astronomers, and I was fascinated! I made new friends and became part of the Colmbian Women Doing Research in Astronomy (CHIA)
								  and the Network of Colombian Astronomy Students <a href="https://recastronomia.github.io/" target="_blank"
									rel="noreferrer noopener">(RECA)</a></b>, where I am now very active helping to grow astronomy awarenes and the scientific community in Colombia.

										<p style="font-weight:300; text-align:justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/quasar_golf.jpg" alt="" width="240" height='320'></span>
									I have now moved on to study my Ph.D. at the International Max Planck Research School - Heidelberg and
										work under the supervision of <a href="https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/banados/index.html" target="_blank"
										rel="noreferrer noopener"> Eduardo Bañados</a>
									  at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. I have been doing research on the first quasars, which are supermassive blach holes living
										in the centers of massive galaxies. I have focused on the quasars born within the first Billion
										years of the Universe, (or at redhisft <i style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:25px">z</i> &#8819; 6) and that are bright in radio wanvelengths,
										like <a href="research.html#p352FIR">this one.</a> I have
										been able to work with optical, near-infrared and radio data from ground-based and space <a href="html5up-parallelism/index.html">telescopes.</a>
										I enjoy living in Germany and although traveling has been restricted, I have been able to grow my astronomy network and continue to do
										what I love. I have learned to PI proposals, be more independent on my research, and take on the every day challenges of Ph.D. live.
										Let's hope for more adventures in the future!

									<p style="font-weight:300"> I find tennis quite cathartic and is undeniably my favorite sport! I started competing in
										high school. However, in the last few years studies have kept me a little busy so I just continue
										playing for fun and health. You can find me practicing in Dossenheim or at the courts of Heidelberg
